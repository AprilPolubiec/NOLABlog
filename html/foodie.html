<h1>The Foodie's 3-day Guide to New Orleans</h1>
<div>
  I hope you packed some loose-fitting clothes, because this one's not for the
  faint of heart (er... small of... stomach?). New Orleans is mostly famous for
  it's cajun and creole cuisine (yes,
  <a
    href="https://www.louisianatravel.com/articles/cajun-vs-creole-food-what-difference"
    >they are different</a
  >), but is also a hotspot for culinary innovation from all over the world
  (most notably France, Spain, Italy &
  <a
    href="https://www.neworleans.com/things-to-do/multicultural/cultures/vietnamese/"
    >more recently, Vietnam</a
  >). With only 3 short days to explore, this guide will ensure that you taste
  all the foods exclusively found in New Orleans. If you want to learn more
  about the history of food, I recommend you check out the 5-day guide. ##Link

<h2>Day 1 - French Quarter Fare</h2>
<div>
  <a href="https://placeholder.com"
    ><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/300"
  /></a>
  It is only fitting to start our journey
  <a
    href="http://www.frenchquartercitizens.org/a-history-of-the-french-quarter/"
    >where it all began</a
  >. The French Quarter (also known as the Vieux Carre) streets might make you
  feel like you've been transported to Europe - you'll find narrow roads lined
  with French- and Spanish-inspired homes, beautiful cast-iron balconies, brick
  roads, & hidden alleyways. Perhaps the most iconic building in the French
  Quarter is St. Louis Cathedral, which takes us to our first stop...

  <h3>Breakfast</h3>
  <a href="https://stanleyrestaurant.com/">Stanley Restaurant</a>
  <div>547 Saint Ann St</div>
  <div>
    Nestled in Jackson Square and catty-corner of the St. Louis Cathedral, this
    is the perfect spot to watch the day unfold as artists set up shop and
    buskers start warming up for their acts. Recommended dishes: Bananas Foster
    French Toast, Breaux Bridge Benedict, Eggs Benedict Poor Boy.
  </div>

  <h3>Coffee/Tea</h3>
  <a href="https://www.pjscoffee.com/decatur/">PJ's Coffee</a>
  <div>501 Decatur St</div>
  <div>
    PJ's is a New Orleans-based coffee shop which you'll see sprinkled
    throughout the city. They're known for their unique coffee bean flavors,
    including Southern Pecan, English Toffee, Southern Wedding Cake & Bananas
    Foster - and yes, that's the bean that's flavored, not syrup. Fun fact,
    their roasting facility is only 1 mile away from this location! Also, their
    Granita is unlike any other blended coffee drink you've had... It's blended
    in a slushy machine which makes its perfectly smooth, is made with espresso
    beans, and has minimal sugar (unless you ask for a flavored syrup). Full
    disclaimer - I used to work here so I may be a little biased, but this is
    hands-down my favorite coffee. Dinner Dessert
  </div>
  <h3>Lunch</h3>
  <a href="https://centralgrocery.com/">Central Grocery and Deli</a>
  <div>923 Decatur St</div>
  <div>
    Don't let the unassuming storefront fool you - this is the only place where
    you will find a real, original Muffuletta. Created by Italian immigrants,
    the Muffuletta is a salami, ham, mortadella, swiss and provolone sandwich on
    a fluffy sesame loaf, topped with a signature olive spread. The "half" size
    is enough to feed 1-2 people and will leave room for the rest of your foodie
    tour. Grab a sandwich and head across the street to the French Market to eat
    and listen to live music.
  </div>

  <h3>Afternoon Snack</h3>
  <a href="https://www.frenchmarket.org/farmers-market/eateries/"
    >The French Market Farmers Market</a
  >
  <div>1008 N. Peters Street</div>
  <div>
    The Farmers Market is a great place to grab little tastes of local fare. You
    can grab some oysters at Jâ€™s Seafood Dock, Gator on a Stick or Gator Jerky,
    pralines at Loretta's, hot sauce and spice samples at the Cafe & Spice
    Emporium, or whatever else you may stumble into. Or, if you're not hungry,
    just stroll down the market to discover local artists and maybe pick up a
    couple souvenirs.
  </div>

  <h3>Dinner</h3>
  Option 1: <a href="https://www.coopsplace.net/">Coop's Place</a>
  <div>1109 Decatur St</div>
  <div>
    "Where the not-so-elite meet to eat." This dark and dingy dive is known for
    its authentic and affordable Cajun food. There will likely be a line out the
    door, but don't let that scare you away - the wait won't be long and you can
    use that time to browse the menu. You may need some time to pick something
    from the list of goodies - Seafood Gumbo, Rabbit & Sausage Jambalaya,
    Redfish Meuniere, Shrimp Creole and more. If you're with company, I
    recommend each getting a different dish and sharing. Otherwise, you can
    always get the Bayou Appetizer and Coop's Taste Plate to get a pretty hefty
    assortment of dishes.
  </div>
  Option 2: <a href="https://www.galatoires.com/">Galatoire's</a>
  <div>209 Bourbon Street</div>
  <div>
    If you're more of a splurger, you may prefer to dine at Galatoire's - a
    jackets-required fine dining French/Creole restaurant which dates back to
    1905. The interior has maintained its historic decor and expect excellent
    service. The Turtle Soup is a must, as well as the Oysters Rockefeller &
    Shrimp Remoulade. For the entrees, you can't go wrong with Redfish or Filet
    Mignon.
  </div>

  <h3>Dessert</h3>
  <a href="https://shop.cafedumonde.com/">Cafe Du Monde</a>
  <div>800 Decatur Street</div>
  <div>
    By this point, you are probably stuffed to the brim, but you cannot leave
    New Orleans without visiting this iconic cafe. Cafe Du Monde is open 24
    hours, so if you need to you can go back to your hotel, take a post-dinner
    nap, and venture back out at midnight for a beignet. Service is simple -
    wait in line (if there is one) and grab a table (nobody will seat you and
    it's every man for himself out there). The menu is incredibly simple with
    only three items: Beignets, Cafe au Lait, & Frozen Cafe au Lait. Beignets
    come in orders of 3 which is more than enough for one person, or you can
    split it with friends. The Cafe au Lait is not just any coffee - it is
    coffee & chicory, a unique flavor developed by the French and brought to
    Louisiana from the Acadians, mixed with steamed milk. If you're a fan, you
    can purchase coffee beans to brew yourself at home.

<h2>Day 2 - Garden District Goodies</h2>
<div>
  <a href="https://placeholder.com"
    ><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/300"
  /></a>
  Today we will explore the food and scenery of the Garden District, a stark
  contrast to the French Quarter. Historically, the Garden District was home to
  a handful of large plantations which over the years were broken up and sold
  off to the wealthy. As you walk along Oak-lined streets, you will see vast,
  secluded mansions and beautiful gardens. Most of our stops today will be along
  Magazine Street, a six-mile long bustling street of restaurants, cafes, &
  shops which stretches from the French Quarter to Uptown. Although there is a
  bus which conveniently runs up along Magazine, I highly recommend walking most
  of the way, and maybe even exploring some of the residential streets north of
  Magazine.

  <h3>Breakfast</h3>
  <a href="http://www.surreysnola.com/">Surrey's Cafe and Juice Bar</a>
  <div>1418 Magazine Street</div>
  <div>
    An absolute must, especially for a hangover. I will warn you - this spot is
    cramped and the wait times can be long, but the food is worth it. The
    Bananas Foster French Toast may be the best dish I've ever had, or if you're
    more of a savory type, you will love the Crab Meat Omelette. This is also an
    excellent spot for vegans and vegetarians! Balance out your indulgent meal
    with a fresh-squeezed juice blended with any combination of fruit you
    choose. While you're waiting for your food, look around at the wonderful
    local art lining the walls and if you look hard enough you may realize you
    are actually sitting in a converted house.
  </div>
  <h3>Coffee</h3>
  <a href="https://www.districtdonuts.com/">District Donuts Sliders Brew</a>
  <div>2209 Magazine St</div>
  <div>
    Best cool brew in the city. Hands down. There's a reason why they sell it in
    growlers. This is also a great place to try Vietnamese Iced Coffee (remember
    that Vietnamese influence I mentioned?), a sweet and creamy but very strong
    take on coffee. And if you're the kind of person who always has room for
    dessert, the donuts and chocolate chip cookies are to die for.
  </div>

  <h3>Lunch</h3>
  <a href="https://www.datdog.com/">Dat Dog</a>
  <div>3336 Magazine St</div>
  <div>
    I know what you're thinking... what could be so great about hot dogs? These
    are <e>not just hot dogs</e>. There is an assortment of dogs to choose from
    - alligator, polish kielbasa, duck sausage and even a vegan italian dog.
    Plus, you can pair your dog with unlimited toppings. If you're adventurous
    like me, pick a sausage and ask for "Chef's Choice" to let the kitchen craft
    up a fun unique dog for you. Or, you can play it safe and pick a
    pre-designed dog.
  </div>

  <h3>Dinner</h3>
  Option 1: <a href="https://www.therumhouse.com/">Rum House</a>
  <div>3128 Magazine St</div>
  <div>
    I've never really understood the hype of going out for tacos. These tacos
    are another story though. The Rum House is a "Carribbean Taqueria" featuring
    a hefty menu of fusion tacos, such as the Trinidad Chicken, Rasta Veggies
    and Lamb Vindaloo. My go-to order is the Two Dat taco combo - 1 Chipotle
    Shrimp , 1 Duck Duck Goose, Fried Plantains and Smothered Greens. Honestly,
    you can't go wrong with any of the tacos. And for an appetizer you have to
    try the Damn Good Nachos - they really are damn good!
  </div>
  Option 2: <a href="https://www.commanderspalace.com/">Commander's Palace</a>
  <div>1403 Washington Ave</div>
  <div>
    For something more high-end, visit this iconic spot for refined Creole
    cuisine which dates back to 1893. It is owned by the Brennan family, one of
    the most influential families in the local culinary scene, has received 7
    James Beard awards and has been home to a number of world renowned chefs
    including Emeril Lagasse & Paul Prudhomme. You really can't go wrong with
    anything here - just make sure you don't leave without trying the Turtle
    Soup!
  </div>
</div>
<h2>Day 3 - Carrollton Cuisine</h2>
<div>
  <a href="https://placeholder.com"
    ><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/300"
  /></a>
  Ok, most people will call this Uptown, but I needed the alliteration of
  Carrollton Cuisine. If you look on a map, you'll notice this area isn't really
  "up" town from anything, but then again the Lower Garden District isn't really
  "lower" than the Garden District and the Bywater isn't really any more "by the
  water" than any other neighborhood, but that's a whole other discussion.
  Uptown is where Tulane University and Loyola University are located, so expect
  a younger demographic and the dive bars and coffee shops come along with it.

  <h3>Breakfast</h3>
  <a href="https://www.neworleans.com/listing/the-camellia-grill/32912/"
    >The Camellia Grill</a
  >
  <div>626 S Carrollton Ave</div>
  <div>
    A fun, old-school diner with no tables - all guests sit together at one long
    counter wrapped around the kitchen. Servers in vintage uniforms are
    efficient and friendly in the true New Orleans spirit. Omelettes are big and
    fluffy. They are also known for their delicious Chocolate Pecan Pie and
    Double-Scoop Freezes.
  </div>

  <h3>Lunch</h3>
  <a href="http://www.bourreenola.com/">Bourree</a>
  <div>1510 S Carrollton Ave</div>
  <div>
    A laid-back bbq joint with indoor and outdoor seating. The Duck Nachos here are one-of-a-kind. All of the wings are amazing, my favorite being the Jerk Wings. Top it off with a fresh fruit daiquiri and a Boudin on the side and you've got yourself a real comfort food meal, NOLA-style.
  </div>

  <h3>Afternoon Snack</h3>
  <a href="https://www.neworleans.com/listing/plum-street-snowballs/32605/">Plum Street Snoballs</a>
  <div>1300 Burdette St</div>
  <div>
    Sno-balls are a staple on a hot Summer day in New Orleans. Unlike snowcones which are made of coarsely shaved ice, sno-balls are made from very finely shaved ice and can be customized with a wide variety of syrups and creams. Some unique flavors include Nectar Cream, Butter Rum, Banana Cream, Pina Colada, Coconut and of course the classics such as Cherry, Mango and Grape. Warning: cash only!
  </div>

  <h3>Dinner</h3>
  <a href="https://jacques-imos.com/">Jacques Imo's</a>
  <div>8324 Oak St</div>
  <div>
    Warm beer. Lousy food. Poor service. The sign outside is far from the truth. In fact, this restaurant is so good, I'm not giving two options for this dinner. This is an absolute <e>must</e>! Jacques Imo's is located on Oak Street, a street which has evolved over the years to be a hotspot for cafes, antique shops and restaurants. If there is a wait, enjoy a nice stroll down the street. When you go to your table, the host will bring you right through the kitchen where the cooks will smile and greet you. Your meal will start with complimentary cornbread (the best cornbread you will ever have) and salad topped with fried oyster. I highly recommend the Blackened Redfish, Grilled Duck Breast, & Crawfish Etouffee. If you're feeling adventurous, the Shrimp and Alligator Cheesecake is a signature dish and fan favorite.
